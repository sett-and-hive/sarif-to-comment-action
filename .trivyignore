# Mitigated: npm-user-validate ReDoS vulnerability (< 1.0.1)
# The CVE was fixed in npm-user-validate 1.0.1.
# We install npm@latest (10.8.2+) which bundles npm-user-validate 2.0.1.
# Trivy may detect it in intermediate build layers before npm@latest is installed.
# Acceptance date: 2025-12-05
CVE-2020-7754

# False Positive: Trivy misidentifies gh cli v2.83.1 as v2.0.0
# The CVE was fixed in v2.62.0. We are on v2.83.1.
